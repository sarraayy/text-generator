# Use of LLM / ChatGPT Assistance
This document explains how I used assistance with parts B and C, which was used as a learning aid throughout my code.

---
## Part B - Transformer Implementation
**Tasks:*
- Implement Transformer with:
- token + positional embeddings
- multihead self attention
- final linear projection
- train 

**Challenges faces**
- Structuring `model.py` with all Transformer components.
- Writing the `generate.py decoding function for sampling.

**How AI helped**
- I asked prompts such as:
> "Can you help me implement a Transformer in PyTorch with token embeddings, final linear projection and such on"?
> "How do I write a generate function to decode tokens from a trained model?"

-AI provided **example code snippets** and **step-by-step explanations for the asked.
- I was able to see how my code differed from given, and was able to grasp an understanding as explanations were given after each line. 
- I adjusted variables for my repo.

With the guidance of AI, I was able to understand and learn how to build `model.py` and `generate.py`.


## Part C - Computations & Training understanding 

**Tasks**
-Answering questions having to do with the machine used for this assignment, by including calculations, references and reasoning.

**Challenges faced**
- Understanding the theoretical formulas and tying them in with my training loop.

**How AI helped:**
-I asked prompts like:
>How do we estimate the FLOPs for forward pass of the Transfoemer?
> Why do my calculations represent a difference in compute and memory bound?

AI helped me understand the computations in my files and allowed me to understand the outputs provided which helped me understand how these numbers correlate with one another. 

##Reflection:

AI acted as a guide/tutor throughout my coding and understanding of some of the questions being asked.
When getting stumped, I would ask AI for an example and explanation which would then help me better understand the assignment
I was able to better my coding throughout this assignment, with the help of AI.
